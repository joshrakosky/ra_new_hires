**Note:** Each code can only be used once. After testing with a code, you'll need to use a different code for subsequent tests, or cancel/delete the test order from the admin panel to reuse the code.

## Admin Access

Use code **ADMIN** (5 letters) to access the admin dashboard with export orders functionality.

## Creating Additional Test Codes

To create more test codes, simply use any 6 capital letters (e.g., TEST01, TEST02, etc.). Codes are validated when orders are submitted, so you can use any 6-letter combination until it's been used for an order.
