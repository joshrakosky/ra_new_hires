# Test Codes for Republic Airways New Hires

## Test Code: ABCDEF

The code **ABCDEF** can be used for testing the complete order flow:

1. Enter `ABCDEF` on the landing page
2. Select program (RA or LIFT)
3. Select t-shirt size
4. Select a kit
5. Enter shipping information
6. Review and submit order

**Note:** Each code can only be used once. After testing with ABCDEF, you'll need to use a different code for subsequent tests, or delete the test order from the database.

## Admin Access

Use code **ADMIN** (5 letters) to access the admin dashboard with export orders functionality.

## Creating Additional Test Codes

To create more test codes, simply use any 6 capital letters (e.g., TEST01, TEST02, etc.). Codes are validated when orders are submitted, so you can use any 6-letter combination until it's been used for an order.
